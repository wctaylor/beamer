Beamer Slide Customization

This project is just an attempt to make a custom Beamer theme for presentations

It includes the five .sty files used to define the theme along with the testing .tex file and the related compilation files

All beamer themes contain colorthemes, fontthemes, innerthemes, outerthemes, and presentation themes (or just themes)

Each such theme is named according to:
    beamertheme[name].sty (theme)
    beamerinnertheme[name].sty (inner)
    beameroutertheme[name].sty (outer)
    beamercolortheme[name].sty (color)
    beamerfonttheme[name].sty (font)

 The theme defined in this project has the <name> Slides
